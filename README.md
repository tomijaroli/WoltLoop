This is my attempt on the Wolt assignment task.
## Project setup
### Prerequisites
The environment uses `Homebrew`, please make sure you have it installed before.

To install dependencies, run the following

## Room for improvement
- Crash reporting via e.g. Firebase Crashlytics
- More streamlined UI - maybe showing restaurants on the map
- View States for loading, error, etc
- Real analytics tracking
- Feature flags
- Fastlane for publishing app
- Better test coverage - e.g. NetworkProvider could have been tested
- UI, integration, snapshot tests
- Accessibility
- SwiftUI preview handling
- Localization
- Fix CI pipeline - can't install dependencies
- Unused code watcher - e.g. Periphery
